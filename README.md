Solutions to Codility programming exercises (lessons).

Codility has a very nice list of programming exercises
on its web site. Specifications of all the exercises
contain the worst-case time and space complexity.

The time and space requirements make the problems
more interesting as some obvious solutions to the
problems do not necessarily satisfy the time and/or
space requirements.

Solutions to all problems include tests.

See https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/
for the descriptions of the programming exercises.
